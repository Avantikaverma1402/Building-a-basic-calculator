Introduction:
This Project is used for Building a Basic GUI calculator used for Basic Arithemetic operations like Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division.
It also has functions like Backspace and clear

Library:
The calculator is created using tkinter library

How it works:
a) Entry Widget: This is where the user will input the expression and view the result.
b) Buttons: There are buttons for numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), the equal sign (=) for evaluation, and a clear button (CLR) to reset the input.

Functions:
a) click_button(value): Adds the clicked button value to the current input.
b) calculate(): Uses the eval() function to evaluate the expression entered in the Entry widget.
c) clear(): Clears the input field.

How to run:
a) Install Python and tkinter (it usually comes pre-installed with Python).
b) Copy the code into a .py file and run it.
c) This code will open a simple calculator GUI where you can enter numbers, perform basic arithmetic operations, and clear the screen.
